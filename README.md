# ColognePhoneticsSharp
This is an implementation of the Cologne phonetics algorithm (KÃ¶lner Phonetik) for .NET

It [was initially written](http://codekicker.de/news/csharp-Implementierung-Koelner-Phonetik--NET) by [Klaus Bock](https://twitter.com/klaus_b0) and he kindly gave me permission to create a nuget package for this.
